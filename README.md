# Hack-Day-10.10.2015

This project was designed for a local hack day durring my freshmen year.  It builds upon space invaders to create
an addictivly fun game, but now with add-ons such as scatter shot which shoots 3 "missiles" that branch out.
Additionally, the "furry" option changes the enemies to cats and their missiles to hair balls.  The begining of
the game opens on the upgrade screen where you can set upgrades active, the buttons change red to show they are active,
this major difference between the last two options (continue and always continue) is that always continue will never
open the upgrade menu again durring the game, the contiue will call the menu at the end of the level.
